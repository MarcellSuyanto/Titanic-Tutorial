# Titanic Tutorial on Kaggle
This is the Titanic Tutorial on Kaggle where I refresh my fundamentals on machine learning, while adding my own parts towards the end.   
   
   [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)
The datasets are available on the [Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)   

Alongside the tutorial, I strengthened my basic knowledge of machine learning and building machine learning models.   
I also improved the accuracy of the tutorial model.   
   
This project is only an appetizer and helps me to remember the fundamentals after a while of not coding machine learning models.
